# 🐍 Python for DevOps – Revision Tasks

This repository contains basic Python programs revised as part of my DevOps learning journey. The tasks cover core Python concepts that are commonly used in infrastructure scripting and automation scenarios.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. `grade_checker.py`
A simple CLI-based grade checker using `if-elif-else` conditions.
- Input: User score
- Output: Grade (A–F)

### 2. `student_grades.py`
A program using dictionaries to:
- Add new students and grades
- Update existing records
- Display all entries

### 3. `write_file.py`
Writes sample content into a text file named `example.txt` using Python's `open()` in write mode.

### 4. `read_file.py`
Reads and prints content from `example.txt` using `open()` in read mode.

### 5. `example.txt`
A simple file created by the `write_file.py` script, used for read operations.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using conditionals effectively
- Working with Python dictionaries
- File I/O operations (`read`, `write`)
- Structuring CLI-based utilities for interactive use

These basics are essential in automating tasks like log analysis, configuration management, and writing quick system scripts in DevOps.
